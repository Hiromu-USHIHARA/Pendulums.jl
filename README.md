## Overview

This repository provides a collection of numerical simulations and animations for:

- Simple pendulum (undamped and damped)
- Forced oscillation and resonance
- Double pendulum in chaotic and linear regimes
- Comparison between numerical and analytical solutions (normal modes)

The core solvers are implemented from scratch, including a 4th order Runge-Kutta and a symplectic Euler integrator.

## Background

The Euler--Lagrange equations for the double pendulum are given as

$$(m_1+m_2){L_1}^2\ddot \theta_1+m_2L_1L_2\left[\ddot\theta_2\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)+{\dot\theta_2}^2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)\right]=-(m_1+m_2)gL_2 \sin\theta_1$$
$$m_2{L_2}^2\ddot\theta_2+m_2L_1L_2\left[\ddot\theta_1\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)-{\dot\theta_1}^2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)\right]=-m_2gL_2\sin\theta_2$$
