## Overview

This repository provides a collection of numerical simulations and animations for:

- Simple pendulum (undamped and damped)
- Forced oscillation and resonance
- Double pendulum in chaotic and linear regimes
- Comparison between numerical and analytical solutions (normal modes)

The core solvers are implemented from scratch, including a 4th order Runge-Kutta and a symplectic Euler integrator.
